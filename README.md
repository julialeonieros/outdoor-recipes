# Friluftsmat (Outdoor recipes) üèï

This is Astrid Persson and Julia Ros's final project in the Technigo bootcamp. A recipe bank with an outdoors theme, with the aim to inspire you on what to eat on your next adventure outdoors. 

The recipes can be filtered on text, tags (quick, vegetarian, fire and gluten-free) and type (breakfast, lunch/dinner, fika). Click on an image to get the full recipe. We also would love it if you shared your own recipe-favorites. Use the form to add your recipe to the gallery, and make sure to upload a yummy image! 

The website can be viewed on desktop, tablet and mobile, so you can bring the recipes outdoors with you.
